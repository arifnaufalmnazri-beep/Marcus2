# Marcus2
I improved my previous lego build by introducing a servo motor at the front of the vehicle to make it change direction

## What improved? 
For the Marcus1, I built and programmed it to only be able move forwards and backwards. Now, since I'd already confirmed that that was possible, I decided to add turning features to it
using a servo motor. After taking the Marcus1 apart and rebuilding the vehicle in order to hold the servo, the car was able to turn left and right through a simple program from the Arduino UNO. 

## How it moves? 
It functions on the same principles as the Marcus1, only this time, the servo changes the direction the front-wheels are facing in order to make the car change directions. The stepper motor turns the axle which moves the car forward. Then, once it's done, it stops and servo causes the wheels to turn, before reversing the car in a different direction than before.
Here's a video of it moving:

## Code
The code is identical to the Marcus1, except with the addition of the servo controls, you can find in thsi link:
